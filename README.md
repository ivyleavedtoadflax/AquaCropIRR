AquaCropIRR
===========

The two R files contained here contain code to rapidly produce irrigation (.irr) profiles files for the AquaCrop model. If multiple irrigation regimes are to be evaluated, writing these files by hand can be a serious investment of time. The files will need to be adapted to suit individual purposes, as they have not been generalised.
